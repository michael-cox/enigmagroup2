## Project Description

In this project, you will be complete the following challenges on [Enigma Group](https://www.enigmagroup.org/pages/challenges): Basic 16–17 (spoofing) and 21–23 (SQL injection). After completing each challenge you will complete the following worksheet describing:
1. The credentials found in the challenge (if any).
2. How you solved the challenge. Include any JavaScript or other scripts you used to solve these challenges.
3. What sins (as found in the *24 Deadly Sins* book) are evidenced in the challenge.
4. How those sins should be addressed to address your exploit.

You can find a basic guide for markdown formatting [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). In particular, note the [code section](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code) which should be used to annotate any code or commands used in your writeup.
